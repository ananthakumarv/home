I joined a super hero club where I try to save as many lives as I can. I'm a very low rank at the moment but I'm going to get to S class very soon. I really want to help as many people as I can.</p>
		<h2>HOW I got this power</h2>
		<p>After I got bullied one day I wanted to be able to fight and be very strong. So I made myself a very strict workout plan which consist of 100 push ups 50 sit ups and a 5km run every single day for 5 years. After that I went bald and was so strong I could one punch anything!<p>

Untill one day a warrior from a very far plent challenged me, we faught till the end I ended up killing him and became a S class warrior!!</p>
